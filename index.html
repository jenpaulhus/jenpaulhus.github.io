<font size="small"><i>Sometimes it's so hard to find what it is  I'm trying to say.  People might think you can turn
    creativity on and off, but its not like that.  It just kinda comes out: a  mash up of all these things you collect
    in your mind. You  never know when it's gonna happen. But when it does, it's like <b>magic</b>. It's just that
    simple.  And it's just that hard.</i> <br> <center> -Gwen Stefani</center></font>

   I joined the math and statistics department at <a href="https://www.mtholyoke.edu/directory/departments-offices-centers/mathematics-and-statistics">Mount Holyoke College</a> this past summer.  For the previous 13 years, I was a professor in mathematics at <A HREF="http://www.grinnell.edu/academics/areas/math-stats", target="_blank">Grinnell College</a>.  My research is primarily in computational math, particularly related to questions in algebra,  number theory, and geometry. Currently I work on questions of how Jacobian varieties decompose,
  and group actions on Riemann surfaces.<br><br>

 I received my Ph.D. from the  <A HREF="http://www.math.uiuc.edu",
                               target="_blank">University of Illinois at
    Urbana-Champaign</a> in 2007 and  I was a postdoc
  at <a href="http://www.math.ksu.edu" target="_blank">Kansas State
    University</A> from 2007-2010. I also spent a year at
                               <A HREF="http://www.villanova.edu/artsci/mathematics/", target="_blank"> Villanova
                                 University</a>. My childhood and formative years were spent in Wild, Wonderful  West Virginia.
