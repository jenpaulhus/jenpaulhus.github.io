<p> Suppose that <i>&chi;<sub>&lambda;</sub></i> and <i>&chi;<sub>&mu;</sub></i> are distinct irreducible characters of the symmetric group <i>S<sub>n</sub></i>. We show how to construct explicitly a permutation <i>&pi;</i> in <i>S<sub>n</sub></i> such that  <i>&chi;<sub>&lambda;</sub>(&pi;)</i> is provably different from <i>&chi;<sub>&mu;</sub>(&pi;)</i>. In
fact, we show a little more. Suppose <i>f</i> is an irreducible character of
<i>S<sub>n</sub></i>, but we do not know which one it is, and we are given only oracle access to <i>f</i>. We give an algorithm that, using only polynomially many
queries to <i>f</i>, determines which irreducible character <i>f</i> is.</p>
