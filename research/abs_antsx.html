<p>We decompose the Jacobian varieties of hyperelliptic curves up to genus 20, defined over an algebraically closed
  field of characteristic zero, with reduced automorphism group A_4, S_4, or A_5. Among these curves is a genus 4 curve
  with Jacobian variety isogenous to E_1^2Ã—E_2^2 and a genus 5 curve with Jacobian variety isogenous to E^5 for E and E_i  elliptic curves. These types of results have some interesting consequences for questions of ranks of elliptic curves  and ranks of their twists.</p>
