 <h1>Branching data for curves up to genus 48</h1>   

 
This project arose from my work decomposing Jacobian varieties of
 curves since in that  work I needed to know the generating vectors for a given
 group acting on a curve.  Thomas Breuer had programs which computed this
 information, but he did not record it with data he generated from those programs. I have added functionality to his
 program to record these generating vectors, and run the programs in Magma
 and GAP up to genus 48.  The data for these generating vectors is below.    <br><br>

The details of this project may be found in this writeup 
    <a href="Monodromy/branchingdatadesc.pdf"> [pdf]</a> and   also posted on
   <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.07657"> ArXiV</a>. <br><br>
 
 I have no plans to publish this work, as it is just a
 modification of Breuer's original work.  If you use the generating vector data, you can cite this page or the ArXiV
 page mentioned above.  I would love to hear from you if you use it.  <br><br>
 


Finally, thank you to Thomas Breuer for giving me permission to repost
this data. <br> <br>

Breuer's code, translated to Magma and modified to print generating vectors. <br>

My code to read the data into Magma, or search the data for specific types
of examples.   <br>

<h2>Groups and Signatures only</h2>

This file gives the list of groups and signatures for all genus from 2 to
48, except two curves of genus 46 of size 2160.  It is simply a compliation of data Breuer created,
updated for the larger current Magma or GAP databases. <br>

<h2>Magma: large groups</h2>

For genus <it>g</it> from 2 to 48, this gives the generating vectors for all groups
of order greater than <it>4(g-1)</it> (again except for the genus  46
examples of size  2160).  <br>

<b> WARNING</b>: This data was computed using Magma V2.19-9. Changes in newer versions of Magma mean that in a couple of cases
an error may be returned. I am working on a permanent fix, but in the short term, if you run into an error and are
running a newer verion of Magma, email me
and I can give you a workaround. Thanks to  Michela Artebani and her student, Cristian Monsalve,  at Universidad de Concepcion for
pointing out the issue.   <br><br>

In genus 46 there is are two groups acting on curves of this genus but which
are beyond the size of the SmallGroup database.  Their information is
recorded here.<br>
