<p>Riemann surfaces are fascinating topological objects with extra structure which allows us to translate ideas from analysis onto them. Additionally, groups can describe ways to permute the elements of a Riemann surface through a process called a group action. To give you a sense of what my field of research entails, we first need to understand group actions and Riemann surfaces. While this may seem like a tall order, you can grasp the ideas of these topics with just a first semester undergraduate course in both algebra and analysis, along with a basic knowledge of the complex numbers (such as roots of unity). An undergraduate course in topology may aid your understanding, but I define key ideas along the way. </p>
