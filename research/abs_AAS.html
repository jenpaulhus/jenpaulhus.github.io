<p> The topological data of a finite group <i>G</i> acting conformally on a compact Riemann  surface is often encoded using a tuple of non-negative integers 
 <i>(h;m<sub>1</sub>,...,m<sub>s</sub>)</i> called its signature, where the <i>m<sub>i</sub></i> are orders of non-trivial elements in the group. There are two easily verifiable arithmetic conditions on a tuple which are necessary for it to be a signature of some group action. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions on a group for the situation where all but finitely many tuples that satisfy these arithmetic conditions actually occur as the signature for an action of <i>G</i> on some Riemann surface. As a consequence, we show that all non-abelian finite simple groups exhibit this property.</p>
