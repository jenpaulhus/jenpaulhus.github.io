<p> We explore the consequences of cwatset isomorphism (there are a finite number of non-isomorphic cwatsets of each
  order) and consider parallels between the theory of groups and the theory of cwatsets (cwatsets of prime order are
  cyclic but direct sums of isomorphic cwatsets aren't necessarily isomorphic).
