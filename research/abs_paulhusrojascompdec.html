<p>We present a new technique to study Jacobian variety decompositions using subgroups of the automorphism group of the
curve and the corresponding intermediate covers. In particular, this new method allows us to produce many new examples
of genera for which there is a curve with completely decomposable Jacobian. These examples greatly extend the list
given by Ekedahl and Serre of genera containing such curves, and provide more ev- idence for a positive answer to two
questions they asked. Additionally, we produce new examples of families of curves, all of which have completely
decomposable Jacobian varieties. These families relate to questions about special subvarieties in the moduli space of
  principally polarized abelian varieties. </p>
