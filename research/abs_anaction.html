<p> We classify up to signature all the ways the alternating group A<sub>n</sub> can act on a compact Riemann surfaces when the quotient genus is greater than 0. In particular, we prove that for A<sub>n</sub> with n>6 every potential signature for the group acting with quotient genus greater than 0 is an actual signature. We also show that in the case of n=5, respectively n=6, the only failure is for [1;2], respectively [1;3].  Along the way we also prove that for any finite simple non-abelian group, all potential signatures with quotient genus greater than 1 are actual signatures.</p>
