<p> For any prime l, it is possible to construct global function fields whose Jacobians have high l-rank by moving to a
  sufficiently large constant field extension. This was investigated in some detail by [Bauer et al, 2008]. The two main results
  of [Bauer et al, 2008] are an upper bound on the size of the field of definition of the l-torsion J[l] of the Jacobian, and a
  lower bound  on the increase in the base field size that guarantees a strict increase in l-rank. Here, we provide
  improvements to both these results, and give  examples which illustrate that our techniques have the potential to
  yield the correct l-rank over any intermediate field of the field of denition of J[l], including base fields that might be too large to be handled directly  by computer algebra packages.
