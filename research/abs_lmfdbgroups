<p> A database of abstract groups has been added to the L-functions and Modular Forms Database (LMFDB), available at <a href="https://www.lmfdb.org/Groups/Abstract/">https://www.lmfdb.org/Groups/Abstract/</a>. We discuss the functionality of the database and what makes it distinct from other available databases of abstract groups. We describe solutions to mathematical problems we encountered while creating the database, as well as connections between the abstract groups database and other collections of objects in the LMFDB.</p>
