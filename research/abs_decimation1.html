<p>Goresky and Klapper conjectured that for any prime p > 13 and
  any l-sequence <b>a</b> based on p, every pair of allowable decimations of <b>a</b> is cyclically distinct. The conjecture is essentially equivalent to the statement that
  the mapping x -> Ax^d, with (d, p-1) = 1, p not dividing A, is a permutation of the even residues (mod p) if and only
  if d = 1 and A=1 (mod p), for p > 13. We
  prove the conjecture for p > 2.26 X 10^55, and establish it in a number of other  special cases such as when 0 <
  d < .000823p or 0 > d > -.000274p.</p>
