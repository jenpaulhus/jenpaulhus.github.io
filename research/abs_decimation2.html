<p> Let p be an odd prime, k,A integers, p not dividing A, d = (p-1, k), d_1 =
  (p-1, k-1), s = (p-1)/d, t = (p-1)/d_1, <b>E</b> the set of even residues in Z/(p), <b>O</b> the set of odd residues, and N_k = #{x in <b>E</b> : Ax^k in <b>O</b>}. We
  give several estimates of N_k, each of different strength depending on the size and parity of s, t and k. In
  particular we show that N_k~p/4 provided that k is even and the set of all k-th powers is uniformly distributed, or k
  is odd and d_1 = o(p). We also show that if t and |A| are both small odd numbers then N_k~(1-1/(At))*(p/4).</p>
