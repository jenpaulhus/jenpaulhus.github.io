<p>The study of Riemann surfaces and the groups which act on them is a classical area of research dating back to the latter half of the 19th century. Research in this field has wide-reaching implications in geometry and topology, algebra, combinatorics, analysis, and number theory through related topics such as the study of dessins dâ€™enfants, mapping class groups, and graphs on surfaces. Today, this is still a rich area of research with many open questions. In this expository article we pose 78 open problems, contextualize them within the field, and discuss partial results or progress toward answering the questions, when relevant.</p>
