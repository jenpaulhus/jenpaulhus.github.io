<p>The problem of finding full automorphism groups of compact Riemann surfaces is classical, though complete results
  are only known for a few families. One tool used in some classification schemes is strong branching; a condition
  derived by Accola. In the following, we survey the main ideas behind strong branching including a general
  survey of current results. We also provide new results for families for which we can find the full automorphism group
  using strong branching and an inductive version of strong branching.
