<p>Curves with automorphism groups of sizes the upper bound for the particular curveâ€™s genus are called Hurwitz curves. In many cases, the automorphism group of these curves is the projective special linear group PSL(2,q). We present a decomposition of the Jacobian varieties for all curves of this type.</p>
