<p> We use recently developed algorithms and a new database of modular curves constructed for the L-functions and Modular Forms Database to enumerate completely decomposable modular Jacobians of level N < 240. In particular, we find examples in 13 previously unknown genera of Jacobian varieties isogenous to a product of elliptic curves over Q. The new genera are: 38, 68, 75, 76, 77, 78, 113, 135, 137, 157, 159, 169, and 409. </p>
