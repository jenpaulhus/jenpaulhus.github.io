<p> Given a fixed genus g, we would like to know the largest possible integer t such that t copies of one elliptic curve E appear in the decomposition of the Jacobian variety JX for some curve X of genus g. In this paper we find nontrivial lower bounds
  for t for genus up to 10. For genus 3 through 6 we demonstrate curves X such that JX~E^g.</p>
