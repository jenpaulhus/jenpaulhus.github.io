<p> The automorphism group of a Riemann surface is an  important object in a
number of different mathematical fields. An algorithm of Thomas Breuer provides
ways to determine all such groups for a fixed genus given a complete classification of groups up to a sufficiently large order, but data generated
from this algorithm did not include the generators of the monodromy group,
another crucial piece of information for researchers. This paper describes modifications the author made
to Breuer's code to add the generators, as well as other new code to compute
additional information about a given Riemann surface. Data from this
project has been incorporated into the L-functions and Modular Forms Database (<a href="http://www.lmfdb.org">www.lmfdb.org</a>) and we also describe the relevant data which may be found there. </p>
