Grading</b> </center><br>
<p>
Your grade will consist of homework, two hour exams and a final.  Homework will
be assigned weekly (except for exam weeks).  I plan to spot grade them--meaning I
will assign a certain number of problems and then only grade 3-5 randomly chosen
problems.  I will drop your lowest homework grade.  Feel free to work in groups on
the homework BUT each student must turn in his or her own solutions.
<p>
I am tentatively scheduling the two hour exams for February 29 and April 18 but
reserve the right to change these dates! If you are going to miss an exam because of
an emergency or illness, please let me know before the exam by e-mailing me.
<p>
The breakdown of grades will be as follows:<br><br>
			Homework:		20%<br>
			In-class Exams:	20% each<br>
			Final:			40%<br>
