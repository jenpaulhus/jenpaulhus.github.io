<b>Grading</b>:<LI><i>Homework</i>: Homework will be assigned roughly once a week and will count as 33% of your final grade. The assignments will be posted below.  Follow all instructions <i>carefully</i>.  </LI>

<LI><i>In-Class Exams</i>: There will be two exams during the semester on <b>Friday October 3</b> and <b> Friday November 14</b>.  They will count as 34% of your final grade (17% each). Nothing but a writing implement will be allowed for these exams. </LI>

<LI><i>Final</i>:  The final is <b>Wednesday December 17 from 4:10-6:00 PM</b>. Do not make plans to go home before this. It will be 33% of your grade for the class. You will be allowed one small sheet of notes for the exam.  More instructions on this may be found at the bottom of the page. </LI>

<LI>The grading rubric for this class may be found <a href="rubric510.pdf">here</a>.   </LI><br><br>

<b>Some notes</b>: <Li>No makeup exams will be given nor late homework accepted unless agreed to beforehand.</LI>
 <LI> I encourage you to  work together to solve homework problems but everyone must write their own solutions. Copied homework assignments will be given a zero. </LI>
<LI> Any student with a disability who needs an accommodation or other assistance in this course should make an appointment to speak with me as soon as possible.</LI>
<LI> At the bottom of this page* you can find information about the honor code.  As stated before, working together on homework is encouraged but the honor pledge does apply to all exams.</LI> 
<LI> There are Help Sessions for this class (and several other 500 level math classes).  A schedule may be found <a href="http://www.math.ksu.edu/main/course_info/help/up-level.htm", target="_BLANK"> here</a>.</LI><br>

<b>Syllabus</b>: We will follow the standard syllabus for this class: Chapters 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, and 13.  <br><br>

<b>Unsolicited Advice</b>:  <li>You're not in calculus anymore. "Plug and Chug" or just mindlessly following in-class examples won't cut it.  The goal of the class is to teach you how to think about the problems and explain your solutions like a mathematician.  Like any new subject, this requires learning the language we use and the conventions for explaining our work.  The best way to do this is to <b>practice, practice, practice</b>.  </li>
<li>Work together when you can.  </li>
<li>If you are struggling, come to see me early.  If you wait until a week before the final, there isn't much I can do to help you.</li>  <br><br>

<p>*Kansas State University has an Honor System based on personal integrity, which is presumed to be sufficient assurance in academic matters one's work is performed honestly and without unauthorized assistance. Undergraduate and graduate students, by registration, acknowledge the jurisdiction of the Honor System. The policies and procedures of the Honor System apply to all full and part-time students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate courses on-campus, off-campus, and via distance learning. The honor system website can be reach via the following URL: <a href="http://www.ksu.edu/honor", target="_BLANK"> www.ksu.edu/honor</a>.

<p>A component vital to the Honor System is the inclusion of the Honor Pledge which applies to all assignments, examinations, or other course work undertaken by students. The Honor Pledge is implied, whether or not it is stated: "On my honor, as a student, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this academic work." A grade of XF can result from a breach of academic honesty. The F indicates failure in the course; the X indicates the reason is an Honor Pledge violation. <br><br>
