e-mail: <a href="mailto:paulhus@math.ksu.edu">paulhus [at] math [dot] ksu [dot] edu</a><br> web site: <a href="http://www.math.ksu.edu/~paulhus/ma160.html">www.math.ksu.edu/~paulhus/ma160.html</a><br> Text: <i>Excursions in Modern Mathematics, 7th edition.</i>, Peter Tannenbaum<br><br>

<b>Grading</b>:   <LI><i>Homework</i>: Homework will be assigned once a week and will count as 30% of your final grade. The assignments will be posted below.  Follow all instructions <i>carefully</i>.  </LI>

<LI><i>Participation</i> will count for 5% of your grade. This grade will come from somewhat regular e-mails you will be required to send me with questions/comments on the current reading and possibly one or two very small presentations.  </li>

<LI><i>In-Class Exams</i>: There will be three exams during the semester on <b>Friday September 18</b>, <b> Friday October 16</b>, and <b> Friday November 13</b>.  They will count as 45% of your final grade (15% each). </LI>

<LI><i>Final</i>:  The final is <b>Wednesday December 16 from 11:50-1:40 PM</b>. Do not make plans to go home before this. It will be 20% of your grade for the class. </LI>

<!--<LI>The grading rubric for this class may be found <a href="rubric160.pdf">here</a>.   </LI>--><br><br>

<b>Some notes</b>: <Li>No makeup exams will be given nor late homework accepted unless agreed to beforehand.</LI>
<LI> Cell phone usage is strictly prohibited during class.  </LI>
 <LI> I encourage you to  work together to solve homework problems but everyone must write their own solutions. Copied homework assignments will be given a zero. </LI>
<LI> Any student with a disability who needs an accommodation or other assistance in this course should make an appointment to speak with me as soon as possible.</LI>
<LI> At the bottom of this page* you can find information about the honor code.  As stated before, working together on homework is encouraged but the honor pledge does apply to all exams.</LI> 
<br>


<b>Unsolicited Advice</b>: <LI> Don't Panic! </LI> 
 <li> Think of math a bit like learning how to bowl.  You can have someone explain to you how to throw the ball and how to put spin on it to make it hit the pins but chances are the first time you throw the bowling ball, you will throw a gutter ball.  How do you improve at bowling?  You practice.  Same thing is true in math.  The best way to learn math is to <b>practice, practice, practice</b>.  </li>
<li>Work together when you can. </li>
<li>If you are struggling, come to see me early.  If you wait until a week before the final, there isn't much I can do to help you.</li>  <br><br>

<p>*Kansas State University has an Honor System based on personal integrity, which is presumed to be sufficient assurance in academic matters one's work is performed honestly and without unauthorized assistance. Undergraduate and graduate students, by registration, acknowledge the jurisdiction of the Honor System. The policies and procedures of the Honor System apply to all full and part-time students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate courses on-campus, off-campus, and via distance learning. The honor system website can be reach via the following URL: <a href="http://www.ksu.edu/honor", target="_BLANK"> www.ksu.edu/honor</a>.

<p>A component vital to the Honor System is the inclusion of the Honor Pledge which applies to all assignments, examinations, or other course work undertaken by students. The Honor Pledge is implied, whether or not it is stated: "On my honor, as a student, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this academic work." A grade of XF can result from a breach of academic honesty. The F indicates failure in the course; the X indicates the reason is an Honor Pledge violation. <br><br>
