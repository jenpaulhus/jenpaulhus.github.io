<b>Homework</b>: There will be 7 homework assigments each given out on a  Monday and due the following Monday. The highest 4 scores will count for 50% of your grade.  Each problem will be graded out of 4 points.  4 and 0 are self explanatory.  3 means you made an error that was slightly more than trivial or did not justify a statement sufficiently. 2 means you were heading in the right direction but did not finish or made a serious error at some point.   1 means you started out on the right track. <br><br>

<b>Final</b>:  There will be a take-home final which will count for 50% of your grade. <br><br>


<b>Syllabus </b>: We will cover most of Part I (Chapters 1-6).  This will cover the Group section of the Algebra Qualifying Syllabus.<br><br>

<!--<i>Commutative algebra with a view toward algebraic geometry</i>, Eisenbud<br>
<i>Algebraic Geometry</i>, Hartshorne<br>
